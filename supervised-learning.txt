When to use supervised learning
    You use supervised learning when you have historical data with labels and you want the model to learn a relationship between inputs and outputs so it can make predictions on new data.

When to Use It
Here are the main situations:

1. When you already have labeled data
    Your dataset contains input features and the correct output for each example.
Example:
    Medical records → (symptoms, test results) → disease diagnosis
    Past sales → (ad spend, season) → revenue

2. When your goal is prediction or classification
    You want to predict future values (regression) or categorize items (classification).
Example:
    Predict stock prices (regression)
    Identify if a transaction is fraudulent (classification)

3. When patterns in data are stable
    The relationship between input and output doesn’t change too fast over time.
Example:
    Predicting electricity usage based on weather (patterns remain fairly consistent)

4. When you can afford labeling costs
    Labeling might require human effort or experts (e.g., tagging images, transcribing audio).
    If you have the resources to create or collect these labels, supervised learning is a good fit.

When NOT to Use It
    No labels available → use unsupervised learning instead.
    Labels are extremely noisy/inaccurate → model will learn wrong patterns.
    The problem is about exploring structure rather than making predictions.

Rule of Thumb:
    If you can phrase your problem as

    "Given X, predict Y"
    and you already have past examples of both X and Y, supervised learning is the right choice.


Here’s a simple decision flowchart to help you decide if supervised learning is the right choice:
          ┌──────────────────────────────┐
          │ Do you have labeled data?     │
          │ (Inputs + correct outputs)    │
          └───────────────┬───────────────┘
                          │ Yes
                          ▼
              ┌──────────────────────────────┐
              │ Is your goal to predict       │
              │ or classify something?        │
              └───────────────┬───────────────┘
                              │ Yes
                              ▼
                  ┌─────────────────────────┐
                  │ Are the labels reliable  │
                  │ and representative?      │
                  └───────────┬──────────────┘
                              │ Yes
                              ▼
                   ┌─────────────────────────┐
                   │ Use SUPERVISED LEARNING │
                   └─────────────────────────┘
                              ▲
                              │ No
          ┌───────────────────┴───────────────────┐
          │   Clean/Improve labels or consider    │
          │   other approaches (semi-supervised)  │
          └──────────────────────────────────────┘

Example Applications
    YES (Supervised Learning) → Predict next month’s sales from past sales & marketing spend.
    NO (Try Unsupervised Learning) → Group customers by behavior when no purchase history labels exist.
    MAYBE (Semi-supervised) → You have some labeled emails (spam/ham) but mostly unlabeled ones.
